This is a sample text file used for testing the DOS text editor.
You can load this file, edit it, add new lines, and then save it again.

The editor should keep everything from this original text
and append anything new that you type afterwards.

Make sure that saving works correctly
and that the output file includes both the old content
and whatever you have added manually.

End of test input.
